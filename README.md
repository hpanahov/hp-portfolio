## [The Differential Impacts of Human Capital and Infrastructure on Sustainable Development: An Empirical Analysis](https://github.com/hpanahov/humanCap_infrastructure) 
This study looks at country-level data to explore the dynamics among human capital, infrastructure, and a country’s progress toward the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Utilizing the confirmatory factor analysis method, I develop a new Infrastructure Index and combine it with the World Bank’s dataset on Human Capital Index to evaluate the relative impact of these factors on a country's SDG scores. My findings affirm the integral roles of both human capital and infrastructure in the sustainable development context. However, a stronger correlation between human capital and the SDG Index suggests that policymakers seeking to advance the sustainability agenda should prioritize investments in human capital over infrastructure. Moreover, the study uncovers nuanced relationships between these indicators and specific SDGs. Human capital has a significant association with SDG 5 (Gender Equality), whereas infrastructure does not. Both human capital and infrastructure affect SDG 1 (No Poverty), with no statistical difference between their effects. Interestingly, while human capital correlates more strongly with SDG 13 (Climate Action), this relationship is negative due to the larger carbon footprint of more developed economies. These findings can inform policy decisions for goal-specific sustainable development strategies.

## [SpaceX  Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction](https://github.com/hpanahov/SpaceX_data) 
**Capstone Project for 'IBM Professional Certificate in Data Science with Python'**   
In this project, I constructed a machine learning model that can predict whether Falcon 9 will land successfully in the first stage. [Falcon 9](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/falcon-9/) is classified as a medium-lift partially reusable rocket, used to launch hefty communications and satellites into Earth orbit or ferry austronaouts to and from the International Space Station. As of April 2022, SpaceX offers Falcon 9 rocket launches for [USD 62 million](https://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/space-launch-costs-growing-business-industry-rcna23488), which means around USD 1,200 per pound of payload. For comparison, per pound cost of SpaceX competitors is 3 to 5 times more expensive, whereas traditional NASA space shuttles, retired in 2011, cost an average of [USD 1.6 billion](https://aerospace.csis.org/data/space-launch-to-low-earth-orbit-how-much-does-it-cost/) per flight. SpaceX is able to provide rocket launches for unprecedented low prices, because it can reuse the first stage, which significantly reduces the demand for new cores. Therefore, determining whether the first stage will land, helps to estimate the cost of a launch. This information can also be used if another company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. For this project, I use API requests to pull data from <code>https://api.spacexdata.com/v4</code> and webscraping to collect data from Wikipedia.
