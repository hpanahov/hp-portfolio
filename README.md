## [SpaceX  Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction](https://github.com/hpanahov/SpaceX_data) 
**Capstone Project for 'IBM Professional Certificate in Data Science with Python'**   
In this project, I constructed a machine learning model that can predict whether Falcon 9 will land successfuly in the first stage. [Falcon 9](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/falcon-9/) is classified as a medium-lift partially reusable rocket, used to launch hefty communications and satellites into Earth orbit or ferry austronaouts to and from the International Space Station. As of April 2022, SpaceX offers Falcon 9 rocket launches for [USD 62 million](https://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/space-launch-costs-growing-business-industry-rcna23488), which means around USD 1,200 per pound of payload. For comparison, per pound cost of SpaceX competitors is 3 to 5 times more expensive, whereas traditional NASA space shuttles, retired in 2011, cost an average of [USD 1.6 billion](https://aerospace.csis.org/data/space-launch-to-low-earth-orbit-how-much-does-it-cost/) per flight. SpaceX is able to provide rocket launches for unprecedented low prices, because it can reuse the first stage, which significantly reduces the demand for new cores. Therefore, determining whether the first stage will land, helps to estimate the cost of a launch. This information can also be used if another company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. For this project, I use API requests to pull data from <code>https://api.spacexdata.com/v4</code> and webscraping to collect data from Wikipedia.
